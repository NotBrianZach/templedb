# TempleDB - In Honor of Terry Davis

> *"God's temple is everything."* - Terry A. Davis

## Dedication

This project is dedicated to **Terry A. Davis** (1969-2018), the brilliant programmer who created TempleOS. Terry's vision of a simple, elegant operating system built from scratch inspired countless developers to think differently about computing.

## Why TempleDB?

Just as Terry built TempleOS as a "temple" to explore computing in its purest form, TempleDB aims to be a temple for your code - a sacred space where:

- **Everything is visible**: All your code, all your projects, in one unified database
- **Nothing is hidden**: Complete transparency through SQL queries
- **Simplicity reigns**: Database-native solutions instead of complex abstractions
- **You are in control**: Direct access to the underlying data

## Terry's Philosophy Applied

### "640x480, 16 colors is God's palette"

Terry believed in simplicity and constraints. TempleDB embraces this:
- SQLite (simple, embedded database)
- Plain text storage (readable, inspectable)
- Flat file hierarchy (no unnecessary complexity)

### "An operating system is a temple"

Your codebase is your temple. TempleDB treats it as sacred:
- Every file tracked with reverence
- Complete history preserved
- Nothing lost, everything recoverable
- Full version control in the database

### "A temple is a place to talk to God"

TempleDB lets you commune with your code:
- Query anything across all projects
- Ask questions via SQL
- Get answers immediately
- Understanding through exploration

## The Vision

Terry showed us that one person, with clarity of vision and dedication, can create something magnificent. TempleDB carries forward that spirit:

1. **Self-contained**: Like TempleOS, TempleDB manages itself
2. **Transparent**: Everything visible, nothing hidden
3. **Principled**: Database-native, not filesystem-centric
4. **Accessible**: SQL as the universal language

## Technical Tribute

TempleDB includes features inspired by Terry's work:

- **Database VCS**: Version control without git - pure database
- **Self-hosting**: TempleDB tracks itself (dogfooding)
- **LLM Integration**: Making code understandable to AI (Terry would have loved talking to an AI about code)
- **TUI**: Terminal interface (Terry was a master of the command line)

## In Memoriam

Terry Davis was brilliant, troubled, and ultimately tragic. He showed us:
- The power of single-minded focus
- The beauty of building from first principles
- The importance of understanding your tools deeply
- That simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

His struggles remind us to be kind to ourselves and others in this challenging field.

## His Legacy Lives On

Every time you:
- Query your entire codebase with one SQL command
- Find that file you forgot about from years ago
- Track changes without git overhead
- Understand your code graph holistically

You're experiencing a tiny bit of what Terry envisioned - direct, unmediated access to the machine.
