# Welcome to the TempleDB Blog

This blog is an example project demonstrating TempleDB's capabilities for managing and tracking projects.

## What is TempleDB?

TempleDB is a database-native project management system that treats your codebase as a temple - a sacred, organized space where every file, every line, every change is tracked, versioned, and queryable.

### Key Features

- **Database-Native Version Control**: All versions stored in SQLite, queryable with SQL
- **File Tracking**: Automatic identification of 25+ file types
- **Environment Management**: Reproducible Nix environments
- **Secrets Handling**: Encrypted secrets with hardware key support
- **Cathedral Packages**: Shareable project bundles

## This Blog

This static site generator demonstrates:

1. **File Tracking**: TempleDB tracks all markdown, Python, and template files
2. **Version Control**: Every change is committed to the database
3. **SQL Queries**: Find all posts with: `SELECT * FROM files_with_types_view WHERE type_name = 'markdown'`
4. **History**: View file evolution over time

## Getting Started

```bash
# Import this project
templedb project import /path/to/blog-engine

# View tracked files
templedb project list

# Check version control status
templedb vcs status blog-engine

# Query with SQL
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/templedb/templedb.sqlite \
  "SELECT file_path, lines_of_code FROM files_with_types_view \
   WHERE project_slug = 'blog-engine'"
```
